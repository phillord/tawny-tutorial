;; == Task {counter:task}: Patternising

;; * Make full use of an existing pattern from Tawny-OWL

;; == The problem

;; * Used value partition to define our properties
;; * Issues with defining the value partition:
;; ** We still have a lot of typing
;; ** The value partition has lots of parts
;; ** Easy to get wrong (e.g. `Polarity`)
;; * How can we simplify and ensure consistency?
;; * Tawny-OWL supports this pattern directly

;; ifndef::backend-slidy[]
;; [NOTE]
;; ====

;; In the previous task we used the value partition to define our
;; amino acid properties.

;; Useful but still have a lot of typing to do; it takes at
;; least 10 lines of code to define one value partition and is made up
;; of many parts.

;; Which means it is easy to get wrong. For example did any one
;; notice that the Polarity value partition was incomplete. We are
;; missing the domain and range restrictions for hasPolarity in the
;; last set of examples. Originally not a deliberate but genuine
;; mistake; but once noticed it was decided to be deliberately left
;; in.

;; How can we simplify and ensure consistency of the value partition?
;; We can make use of patterns. Just so happens that Tawny supports
;; this particular pattern directly.

;; * The value partition pattern is found in `tawny.pattern`
;; * We `use` it here

;; == The `Size` value partition

;; * This is a new form
;; * Syntactically similar to what we seen before
;; * `defpartition` defines that we will have a partition
;; * `[Tiny Small Large]` are the values
;; * `hasSize` is implicit -- it will be created

(defpartition Size
  [Tiny Small Large]

;; ifndef::backend-slidy[]
;; [NOTE]
;; ====
;; This is syntactically similar because it's just a new function defined in the
;; language. We are adding nothing clever here just using a language as it is
;; intended to be used.

;;         aa:AminoAcid
;;     Range:

;;         Functional

;; Class: aa:Size
;;     EquivalentTo:

;; == More value partitions

;; * Adding partitions for all the properties is easy

;; == Using these partitions

;; * `defpartition` also applies the `as-facet` function
;; * So, we can use `facet` also
;; * Syntactically, defining the ontology has simplified
;; * Same semantics underneath

 ;; and the rest

;; ----

;; == Task {task}: Conclusions

;; * Tawny-OWL directly supports the value partition
;; * This integrates with facets
;; * Together, can simplify this (very common) form of ontology

;; == Task {counter:task}: Create New Syntax

;; * Create new syntax describing the amino acids
;; * Create all the defined classes
;; * Use the reasoner

;; == The Finale

;; * This is rather more advanced
;; * Generate a new syntax
;; * But pulls together most of the tasks
;; * Demonstrates the value of a *programmatic* environment
;; * Possible to build ontologies without this
;; * The biology is interesting also

;; ifndef::backend-slidy[]
;; [NOTE]
;; ====
;; This is going to be a highly advanced, showing an high programmatic use of
;; Tawny. In this course of this we will generate some brand new syntax -- this
;; demonstrates one of the uses of tawny -- while it is harder to generate this
;; new syntax, than just use existing, once you have done it is easier to use.

;; There is also some interesting biology and an interesting
;; ontological question that comes out of the end of it.

;; == Defining our `amino-acid`

;; * Done this before
;; * It involves too much typing
;; * Want new syntax
;; * Ensure consistency across all class definitions

;; ifndef::backend-slidy[]
;; [NOTE]
;; ====
;; Building amino acids by defining a class for each is no good at
;; all, as it's too long. Also, it's still too risky. So, we are going
;; to expand the syntax, so that it will works better and ensures
;; consistency across all class definitions.
;; ====
;; endif::backend-slidy[]

;; == Defining our `amino-acid`

;; * The function is relatively easy
;; * `defdontfn` gives default ontology handling
;; * Name of the function `amino-acid`
;; * `& properties` is variadic or "one or more args".
;; * `owl-class` function does *not* define a new symbol

;; [source,lisp]
;; ----
(defdontfn amino-acid [o entity & properties]
  (owl-class o entity
     :super
     (facet properties)))
;; ----

;; ifndef::backend-slidy[]
;; [NOTE]
;; ====
;; The function for making a new amino acid is relatively simple, as
;; these things go. It just passes off most of it's work to
;; `owl-class`. We could also add "AminoAcid" as a superclass here,
;; but I chose to do this later for reasons that should become
;; apparent.

;; This function does not intern -- we can define a new amino-acid
;; like this, but the `entity` would be a string and we cannot refer
;; to it afterwards as anything other than a string.

;; We cannot just replace `owl-class` with `defclass` to achieve
;; this. The explanation requires knowledge of lisp, but it is this:
;; because amino-acid is a function it's arguments are evaluated so we
;; cannot pass a bare symbol -- Clojure will crash. More `defclass` is
;; a macro, so it will be called when the `amino-acid` is evaluated
;; NOT called. We have to make a macro to do this; for more
;; information see Q&As.
;; ====
;; endif::backend-slidy[]

;; == Defining lots of `amino-acids`

;; * Let's define all twenty `amino-acid` at once
;; * Pass definitions as a list (of lists)
;; * 1. Call using `map`
;; * 2. The anonymous function *destructures*
;; * 3. `->Named` packages name and entity together

;; [source,lisp]
;; ----
(defdontfn amino-acids [o & definitions]
  (map
   (fn [[entity & properties]]
     ;; need the "Named" constructor here
     (->Named entity
              (amino-acid o entity properties)))
   definitions))
;; ----

;; ifndef::backend-slidy[]
;; [NOTE]
;; ====
;; Why stop there? Better than creating one amino-acid, let's create
;; all twenty of them at once.

;; This function does three things
;; 1. map applies the anonymous function (contaains `amino-acid`
;; function) to each definition.
;; 2. destructures (Lisp specific): splits definitions into
;; Entity (first value of definitions) and & properties (rest i.e. all
;; values of definitions)
;; 3. it bundles the return value with the name of the entity (which
;; is the first element of the definition).
;; ====
;; endif::backend-slidy[]

;; == And make variables

;; * We want to use symbols and define a new variable
;; * Tawny-OWL has some support for this
;; * Not going to explain in detail

;; [source,lisp]
;; ----
(defmacro defaminoacids
  [& definitions]
  '(tawny.pattern/intern-owl-entities
    (apply amino-acids
     (tawny.util/name-tree ~definitions))))
;; ----

;; ifndef::backend-slidy[]
;; [NOTE]
;; ====
;; We want to transform a bunch of symbols into strings because we are going to
;; use symbols we have not defined yet. We are missing the fact that the symbol
;; name and the string are equivalent here, so we could do this better, but the
;; `name-tree` function is too handy here. `intern-owl-entities` achieves the
;; same thing as defentity.
;; ====
;; endif::backend-slidy[]

;; == Define the amino acids

;; * Now we can define all twenty amino acids in one go
;; * The syntactic regularity means we are unlikely to miss something
;; * This makes the effort worth while
;; * We also define subclasses, disjoints and covering
;; * Pay attention to the `:cover`

;; Protege is really nice for visualising ontologies. So, we use that
;; here. I always save to the same file name, but better to save as
;; OWL rather than OMN because it parses better.
;; ====
;; endif::backend-slidy[]

;; == Visualising

;; * Many defined classes are equivalent
;; * Many are unsatifisable
;; * Happens because there are 20 amino-acids
;; * But 431 defined classes
;; * Many defined classes have necessarily the same extent
;; * Many can not have any individuals (`Negative` and `Hydrophobic`)
;; * Only happens *with* the covering axiom

;; image::protege-unsatisfiable.png[height=300]

;; ifndef::backend-slidy[]
;; [NOTE]
;; ====
;; The reason that this happens is obscure, perhaps, but the base reason is
;; because we have many more defined classes than we have primitive ones. So, we
;; must have equivalences or unsatisifiables.

;; This only happens because of the magic `:cover` axiom. We know all of the
;; amino acids that exist --- as there are no hydrophobic charged amino-acids (as
;; the two facets are not independent for obvious reasons of chemistry!), that
;; class becomes inconsistent. Without the `:cover` axiom, the reasoner would
;; assume that this class *could* exist but we have just not mentioned it.

;; So, the reasoning is telling us something about the biology -- and whether we
;; want this form of conclusion depends on whether we are talking about biology
;; or chemistry -- after all if we were a chemist many amino acids could be
;; created that separate out of equivalent classes, and many make some
;; unsatisifiable classes satisfiable.

;; Life is complex but, in this case, simpler than chemistry.

;; * We can use highly programmatic nature of Tawny

;; * To do so is useful

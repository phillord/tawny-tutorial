* IDEs

I need a nice IDE to recommend. Starting with Emacs may be problematic.



** Gorilla REPL

Runs directly from lein command line -- which means people need to be command
line savvy and pre-install lein.

GUI is rather clunk and uses a lot of space. Difficult to go back and change.




** NightCode

Single jar installation, including lein.

Pops up windows hard right on wrong screen.

Relatively easy to set up a project though.

Seems to crash


** catnip

Requires lein, but cuter than gorilla



* Display

Do the whole thing in org with reveal?

reveal does this irritating autozoom thing which is rather unfortunate. It
means I have to be careful about the amount of stuff on screen, since I can't
scroll like I can with asciidoc/slidy.

This can be switched off, but the scroll bars don't come back, so it's
useless.

Also, it doesn't record what slide I am on, so the autoreload thing doesn't
work.

And I can't do the single slide thing.



* Syllabus


** Section 1 -- intro to hello world

*** Introduction

 - Welcome
 - What is the history (the karyotype ontology)
 - What is tawny (a programmatic API)

*** Key Features

 - Aimed at ontology building, NOT manipulation.
 - Unprogrammatic syntax, minimal baggage
 - Broadcasting
 - Fully extensible
 - Integrated reasoning
 - Build on commodity language
 - Access to fully programming tool chain (unit tests, git, build, dependency)

*** Tawny environment
 
 - Tawny architecture
 - Build on Clojure
 - Clojure is a lisp, build on JVM
 - Sits on top of OWL API

*** Pre-requisites

 - JVM
 - Protege (for some of it)
 - lein
 - https://github.com/phillord/tawny-tutorial

*** Clojure Hello World

 - Key Feature of Tawny
 - Also, key disadvantage over Protege/OBOedit
 - Need a working Clojure environment
 - Your mileage may vary -- feel free to skip

 - Obtaining this tutorial: either git or download
 - Leiningen
 - Run lein catnip
 - Open Hello World, and run it.
 - Also try out the REPL

 - Other options
 - Emacs with CIDER
 - Eclipse with Counter-Clockwise
 - Cursive
 - Lighttable


*** How to follow

 - A complete leiningen project
 - src/tawny/lisbon
 - Place to try stuff in...
 - src/tawny/lisbon/hello_1.clj
 - Solutions (and all these slides)
 - src/tawny/lisbon/hello_1_s.clj


*** Tawny Hello World

 - Namespace declaration -- this is a template, just copy it!
 - I should do all the namespaces
 - defontology form
 - defclass
 - Comments, labels and general tawny syntax
 - defoproperty
 - the use of the "owl-" prefix
 - save-ontology and open in protege


** Section 2 -- basic amino acid ontology

*** Introduction

 - We build a small ontology of amino acids
 - Nice because it's tractable and well-defined.
 - Also start to build patterns


*** Define the class

 - AminoAcid
 - Glycine, Alanine
 - "super" keyword -- not "subclassof"
 - Tawny is idempotent (generally)
   

*** as-subclasses

 - Painful, so introduce a pattern
 - as-subclasses
 - :disjoint
 - :cover
 - Interesting ontological question -- the biologists will say this is correct
 - The chemists will not.

   
*** Defining the Properties

 - Want to define amino-acids by their properties
 - Are a set of standard characteristics we can use
 - Most are numerical
 - We build an abstraction which is the value partition
 - as-subproperty
 - Define a value partition by hand
 - Introduce as-facets


*** Formal Use of patterns
 
 - defpartition


** Section 3


*** Identifiers in Tawny

 - Tawny name, Clojure identifiers and URIs
 - How to build an OBO ID ontology
 - Building an ontology with strings
 - Why symbols are good

*** Importing, requiring and using an ontology

 - Introducing an external ontology
 - Why importing is not (necessarily) enough
 - read

*** AminoAcid with sio

 - equivalents and same as


*** How to program an autosave function
 - Clojure Java 101
 - Proxies
 - Listeners
 
*** The amino-acid pattern

 - Advanced
 - Build the pattern
 - Add SmallAminoAcid
 - Add SmallPolarAminoAcid

 - Reasoning
 - Add them all (do don't show)
 - Filtering

*** Advanced Extensions
 
 - No more follow my leader

 - Axiom Annotations
 - Work patterns
 - Git (any we don't need URI gen)
 - Unit Testing
 - Continous integration
 - Polyglot
 - Memorize
 - Scaffolding


*** The Future
 
 - Literate Ontologies
 - In Tawny pattern language (complete)
 - Manual!
